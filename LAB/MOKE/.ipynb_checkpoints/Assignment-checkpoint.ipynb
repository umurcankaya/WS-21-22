The section \"Getting Started with Python\" in the manual goes through each code section below. You do not need to change the \"Constants\" or \"Calculation loop\" sections (though you can change the constants if you like just to see what would happen). Note that while we specify the units in the comments, we don't actually put any units on the numbers themselves. The code to plot the height as a function of time has been left in so that you know whether your simulation worked or not."

    "While you won't have to write your own code, the MAT file \"Q5 Data\" on eClass contains the results of an electromagnetism simulation. Rather than an initial-value problem (IVP) like you solved in Q1, this is a boundary-value problem (BVP). We specify certain boundary conditions like \"the derivative of magnetic field strength with respect to time is 0 along the line y = 0\". We specify the differential equations that describe the physical system, set up some 2D arrays (instead of 1D like `s` and `r` above) and let the algorithm crunch out what the values should be in our grid. Technically, this simulation used the Finite Element Method (FEM) where we create a mesh of triangles and calculate the value in each triangle, but the idea is the same. One problem with using a grid of rectangles is it's hard to properly represent circles. The mesh used to solve the system is shown in the lab manual. However, the data in the MAT file has been sampled on a regular grid for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical system we were modelling is a sheet of conductive paper that has two long, straight electrodes painted on either side with silver paint, and an annulus between them (also in silver paint). Using a power supply, one straight electrode is held at 4.5 V, and the other at 0 V. The silver ring in the middle is left alone. We can then use a multimeter to measure the voltage anywhere on the surface of the paper. We then compared it to a simulation and found that it matched very closely!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab manual, there is a contour plot overlaid with a stream plot of this simulation. The grey dashed lines show where the silver paint would have been on the actual sheet. The bands of colour indicate the general voltage in that region, and the solid, dark grey lines between each colour band are called equipotential lines. The voltage is exactly the same anywhere on a given line. The black stream arrows on top allow you to visualize the direction of the electric field. It's quite interesting that no field lines penetrate the silver ring in the middle! There are very good physical reasons for that as you'll learn in your EM courses.\n",

    "\n",
    "Import the data from \"Q5 Data.mat\" on eClass. We have already imported `scipy.io as sio` so that we can use SciPy's `loadmat` function. Unfortunately, the CSVs we've been using up to now are not well-suited for 3D matrices of data. If you print your data after importing it, you may notice that there's a header followed by some data. However, the MAT file is being stored as a dictionary rather than a list, so we can't just index into it using `myData[0]` or `myData[1]`; we need to use the correct key instead as in `myData['correctKey']`. Dictionaries will tell you what keys are stored in them if you use `myData.keys()`. Look at the keys available to you, and use the correct key to store just the data array to a new variable. This is now a regular matrix and you can index into it as you usually would. `myMatrix[0, 0]` should get you a list in the form `[x, y, z]` where *x* and *y* are just the *x* and *y* coordinates on the sheet of paper, and *z* is the voltage at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot a 3D surface plot of the data and a contour plot of the data. You can use either `plt.contour` or `plt.contourf` for the contour plot, but contourf is more fun to look at. Because the data array pulled from the MAT file is an M * N * 3 matrix, if we slice it correctly, we can get the three, 2D matrices that we need as both types of plots are expecting three arguments—X, Y, and Z—each of which is a 2D matrix. We don't require axis labels this time for either plot, though you may want to try adding them.\n",
